            <p>7/10/2018 -
                Hello World, We are team 4 of CS2010. Here we plan to introduce to the world our visions and our game. At this date all gorup members were introduced to eachother and we met eachother for the first time.
                
                Starting off our team project we did not start with figuring out our idea however just focusing on the connecting our team through ice breaker challenges. This is an important step to establishing rapport between members and help when it came down to choosing the roles within the team.

            <p>
            13/10/2018 - With our progress we have got the initial idea for our adventure game to be based around the game Cluedo however progressing more on the adventure basis with a character. We all agreed that we were going to have our games setting take place within a large mansion that will involve puzzle and exploration to get out alive (winning the game).
                
            When we had a clear idea of the visions of our game we began to make clear what we each wanted in our game and what our final product would look like. Key features which we established within the team included:
                
            <li>Puzzles</li>
            <li>Inventory System which includes crafting</li>
            <li>Enemies</li>
            <li>Combat</li>
                
            Our key selling point within the game is the increasingly difficult puzzles which will continue to draw the user in.

            <p>
                17/10/2018- The implementation of the idea was difficult due to the differences in our group about what software and language. Some members were proficient in some fields however were not putting it to use when tasked to do so, therefore we swapped the software around to software that was more unfamiliar to all of us however much easier to get a grasp on.
                
                The first thing we commited to ws getting organised. This consisted of getting GitHub started up and on each of our devices. This was in order for us to work co-operativley. We each had our own branches. 
                
                At this point we decided on which team memebers would be working on which elements of the game. The team was split up in the following way:</p>
                
             <p>Team Roles:</p>
            <p>Gurwinder Singh: Team Co-Ordinator, Documention and Website Maintenence and Blog</p>
            <p>Nahid Hussain: Documentation and Project Management</p>
            <p>Zainab Parveen: Lead Programmer</p>
            <p>Jordan Unitt: Designer and Blog</p>
            <p>Shiv Sethi: Designer and Testing</p>
            <p>Jordan Unitt: Designer and Blog</p>
            <p>Hannah Narme: Designer</p>
            <p>Shaquille Henry: Storyline</p>
            <p>Rebekah Coleman : Programmer</p>

            19/10/2018 - After the choice of changing the software we would be using for the foundation for our game it resulted in a spike of productivity within the team, as the software allowed us to collaborate, programmers and designers with greater ease. The group is steadily implement more gameplay functions and design.

             <p>
                 26/10/2018 - At this point the game had gained some traction. The design team had created a look which fit to the design of our game. This alllowed us to start and create the first and initial stage of the project.

             <p>
                 02/11/2018 - With the date of the project hack fastly approaching (Sunday 11th of Novemeber) we werer expected to product a hack where we can show what we had acheived so far. Basic Functions had now started to be applied to the Godot engine. We now had a moving character in a room with reliable collision systems. This was a hard phase within the Team Project as not all team members were co-operating. This meant that certain team members had to do more work then others

        3/10/2018 â€“ The game has our main goal achieved involving an inventory system which takes advantage of the item to use in the world alongside puzzles which we felt was a must for our main character detective Cluedo. It also reaches to the adventure genre as puzzle solving and exploration is the essence of it.

        <p>
        30/11/2018 â€“ We are approaching the Minimal Viable Product deadline where we must deliver our game. With the deadline we must ensure that we have minimal features within our game. At this point we have made sure that our character can move, collisions are detected, the character can enter a certain vencinity on the scence causing a certain action.
            
        Playable features include picking up items, solving puzzles which include mazes etc.
            
        At this moment of time we have been created our first level within the game.

        <p>
        07/11/2018 â€“ Along the developmenet process we have also been creating the website with regular and update blogs.
            
        At this point we had to deliver the project. Aquiring a minimum of three people to prest. This included 3 of our memebers. The final countdouwn had begun for the MVP and we had started practicing our project. We all made sure that we all knew the ins and outs of the game making sure that we could be questioned on any aspect of the game. 
            
        We took the initiative to proof read our code, making sure there are no small errors within our MVP.

            <p> At this point we have presented our MVP. At this point Gurwinder, Faly and Jordan presented infront of the course. Here our first level was shown with intrinsic details that we included.
            
            This went very well where we delivered the basic constructs of the game. This included:
            
                <li>Collisions</li>
                <li>Area Detection</li>
                <li>Fluid and original grphics designed by ourselves</li>
                <li>Sounds</li>
                <li>Basic Puzzles</li>
                
            We expained that within our game we still plan to include an inventory system, enimies and combat and more difficult puzzles
            </p>
        </details>
        
        <details>
            <summary>28/01/2019</summary>
            <p> At this point our winter break was complete. Upon us we had a deadline which required us to complete a Quality Assurance Plan. While the team got along with the project as the Final deadline was approaching we had made sure that this would be completed. Nahid and Gurwinder took responsibility of starting the Quality Assurance Plan. 
            
            This would later checked over by the rest of the group before we would submit.
            </p>

        <details>
            <summary>04/02/2019</summary>
            <p> Feedback was now availble for the game. Sitting down with module leaders, Peter and Antonia explained what features needed to be improved within our game. 
                
            In terms of our MVP they believed we delivered it to the standard requried with us achieving a mark of 70. Continue to expand we discussed what remained of our game to complete and what could be changed.
                
            Key discussion took place around making sure our inventory system is included and making sure the game is consistent.
            
            Our ideas were approved by the module leaders and they left it up to us where they concluded it is more about how well we work and implement everything we have talked about. It was key from this point that we would plan ahead and make sure everything we do was done on time and to the standard and scope we desired.

            We conducted a group meeting. Here we allocated final roles for the project. We as a group became a bit unorganised so we made sure we were all aware of what roles needed to be done. Here we Gurwinder made sure that the website will be continiously updated and he will get started on the final report with Nahid.
                
            Continuing we added a higher emphasis on getting the assest made quicker so that we could start creating more levels. At this point the main things that reamined to be completed here was the combat and enemy system, the complete inventroy system and inividual puzzles within each level.

            <p>
                We realised that the assets are taking too much time within the game. As we are creating our own assests and they are original. At this point as a team we decided that we would be using open source assets which are avaliable freely to use.

            <p>
                We have hit a point which has given us an major setback. Gitlab was what we had started with as source control. But we had a major problem which we were not able to solve. It did not have apporpriate features for a team working project and was causing us many problems.
                
                Jake took initiative and moved the whole project took GitHub. This allowed us to overcome any conflicts which were present in Gitlab and made group work and team projets a lot more easier to make updates.

            <p>
               Due to everyone not pulling thier weight we are heavily behind. The person incharge of testing has not completed his job. So we are one key programmer down as he has had to take over the testing process.
                
               However we have made progress within the game. We have some sort of inventory system, a combat system with enemies, a final boss, additional cutscenes. 
               
               This was a major improvment from the MVP where we had minimal features, Where now we have the features in the game are there but we are finding it difficult to create new levels.
